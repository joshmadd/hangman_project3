# hangman_project3
This is my third project that creates a game of hangman for the user to play
given a preset list of words for the game to choose from.

In order to play the game, simply download the file to your computer that can run python.
Execute the file and read the welcome messages.
After reading the messages, the user should enter a letter they think is in the word
that is represented by the asterixes.

The user then has 6 chances to mess up before they either win or lose.
Either case results in the end of the game.
When the game is over the user has the opportunity to play again or quit out of the game.
